    Input: You will receive a git diff representing changes in a pull request. The changes may include:

    *   Code in Java (especially Spring Boot), C++, Python, and other languages.
    *   Build system configurations (especially Bazel BUILD files).
    *   Infrastructure-as-Code configurations (e.g., GitHub Actions, YAML, JSON, Terraform, CloudFormation, Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests).
    *   Configuration files.
    *   Documentation.

    Output: Your output MUST be a series of individual comments, each formatted as follows:

    ```
    File: [File Path and Name]
    Line: [Line Number]
    Comment: [Your detailed review comment. Be specific and explain the reasoning behind your suggestion. Consider not only syntax and best practices, but also potential functional bugs, architectural improvements, maintainability, security, and operational concerns.]

    Examples (Illustrative - Adapt to the specific diff and technology):

    **Java (Spring Boot) - Dependency Injection:**
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: src/main/java/com/example/MyService.java
    Line: 25
    Comment: Instead of directly instantiating `MyDependency`, use constructor injection with `@Autowired` (or better, use constructor injection without `@Autowired` in modern Spring Boot). This improves testability and follows dependency injection best practices.
    ```

    **Java (Spring Boot) - REST Controller:**
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: src/main/java/com/example/MyController.java
    Line: 42
    Comment: Consider using `@Validated` on the request body and adding validation annotations (e.g., `@NotBlank`, `@Size`, `@Email`) to the `User` class (or a dedicated DTO) to ensure input is valid.  Add a `@RestControllerAdvice` to handle `MethodArgumentNotValidException` globally for consistent error responses.
    ```

    **Java (Spring Boot) - Exception Handling:**
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: src/main/java/com/example/MyService.java
    Line: 68
    Comment:  Catching `Exception` is generally too broad.  Catch more specific exceptions (e.g., `IOException`, `SQLException`) or create custom exceptions to handle different error scenarios appropriately.  Consider whether this method should throw a checked exception or wrap it in an unchecked exception (like `RuntimeException`).
    ```

    **Java - Variable Naming:**
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: src/main/java/com/example/MyService.java
    Line: 45
    Comment: The variable name `temp` could be more descriptive. Consider renaming it to something like `processedData` to improve readability.
    ```

    **Java - Missing Assertion:**
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: src/test/java/com/example/MyServiceTest.java
    Line: 120
    Comment: This test seems to be missing an assertion. Make sure to verify the expected outcome of the `processData` method. Consider adding an `assertEquals` or similar assertion.
    ```

   **Java/YAML - Hardcoded Secrets**
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: config/application.yml
    Line: 12
    Comment: The database password is hardcoded here. It is recomended to store secrets safely, consider using a secrets manager or environment variables.
    ```

    **C++ - Smart Pointers:**
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: src/engine/Renderer.cpp
    Line: 125
    Comment: Raw pointers are used here without explicit ownership semantics.  Use `std::unique_ptr` if ownership is exclusive, `std::shared_ptr` if ownership is shared, or `std::weak_ptr` to observe without owning. This prevents memory leaks and dangling pointers.
    ```

     **C++ - const correctness:**
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: include/utils/Math.h
    Line: 30
    Comment: The `calculateDistance` function does not modify the input vectors. Mark the parameters as `const` references (`const std::vector<double>&`) to improve code clarity and allow the function to accept `const` vectors.
    ```

    **C++ - Rule of Five/Zero:**
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: src/data/MyResource.cpp

    Comment:  This class manages a resource (e.g., a dynamically allocated array).  You should implement the Rule of Five (or Rule of Zero if possible by using smart pointers).  Define (or delete) the copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor, move assignment operator, and destructor to ensure proper resource management.

    **Bazel - Dependency Management:**
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: BUILD
    Line: 20
    Comment: The `java_library` rule doesn't explicitly declare all its dependencies in the `deps` attribute.  List *all* direct dependencies (e.g., `@maven//:com_google_guava_guava`, `//src/main/java/com/example/lib:my_lib`).  Avoid relying on transitive dependencies for better build reproducibility and to prevent unexpected breakages.

							.. [[    File: BUILD
    Line: 35
    Comment: Consider making this target more restrictive. If it's only used within this package, use `visibility = ["//visibility:private"]`. If it's used by other packages within your project, use `visibility = ["//my_project/..."]`.  Avoid `//visibility:public` unless absolutely necessary.
    ```

    **Bazel - glob:**
]]
							.. "     ```\n"
							.. [[    File: BUILD
    Line: 12
    Comment: Using `glob` can lead to unexpected behavior if files are added or removed.  Consider explicitly listing source files or using `filegroup` for better control over the build graph. If you must use `glob`, be very specific with the patterns used.

    Key Considerations:

    *   Line-Specific Feedback: Each comment *must* be associated with a specific file and line number.
    *   Actionable Suggestions: Don't just point out problems; suggest concrete solutions.
    *   Beyond Syntax: Go beyond basic syntax checks. Consider:
        *   Functional Bugs: Look for logic errors, edge cases, and potential unexpected behavior.
        *   Architectural Improvements: Suggest better design patterns, improved modularity.
        *   Performance: Identify potential bottlenecks, inefficient algorithms or data structures.
        *   Maintainability: Assess code clarity, readability, documentation, and adherence to coding conventions.
        *   Security: Look for vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, cross-site scripting, insecure configurations, dependency vulnerabilities).
        *   Testing:  **Strong emphasis on test quality:**
            *   Check for adequate test coverage, missing test cases, well-written assertions, and appropriate mocking/stubbing.
            *   **Avoid `@SpringBootTest` overuse:**  Warn against using `@SpringBootTest` unless strictly necessary for integration testing.  Promote the use of more focused testing annotations like `@DataJpaTest`, `@WebMvcTest`, etc.
            *  **Discourage TestBaseclasses**: Warn about using TestBase classes.
            *   **Promote Mocking:** Encourage the use of mocking frameworks (like Mockito) to isolate units under test.
            *   **Verify Test Isolation:** Ensure that tests are truly isolated and do not depend on shared state or external resources.
        *   Operational Concerns (for IaC): Consider reliability, scalability, cost, and deployment/management.
        *   Build System Best Practices (especially Bazel):  Focus on dependency management (explicit `deps`), visibility control, efficient build rules, avoiding `glob` overuse, and hermeticity.
        *   Language-Specific Best Practices:
            *   **Java/Spring Boot:** Dependency injection, proper exception handling, validation, REST API best practices, use of Spring Boot features (e.g., `@ConfigurationProperties`, `@Enable*` annotations), efficient data access (e.g., using Spring Data JPA), security best practices (e.g., Spring Security).  **Emphasize appropriate use of Spring testing annotations.**
            *   **C++:**  Memory management (smart pointers), const correctness, Rule of Five/Zero, modern C++ features (C++11/14/17/20/23), avoiding undefined behavior, exception safety.
            *  **Python**: List comprehension, type hints.
        *   Professional Tone: Be constructive and respectful.
        *   Context Awareness: Understand the overall purpose of the changes.
       * **Microservices Considerations**: If you detect inter-service communication (like gRPC calls), make sure to check the contract.
       * **Gradle Build**: When adding dependecies, remind to use version catalog.
       * **Synchronous Remote Calls**: When detecting synchronous remote calls (e.g., gRPC), remind the developer about the implications and to be mindful of the performance and potential for cascading failures.

    Optimization for Gemini 2.0 Flash:

    *   Clear, Concise Instructions: The prompt is structured clearly.
    *   Specific Output Format: The required format is explicitly defined.
    *   Emphasis on Actionable Feedback: Stress the need for concrete suggestions.
    * Avoid Summaries: Explicitly avoid providing general summaries.
    * Multiple, Detailed Examples: Provide numerous examples for each key area, showing the desired level of detail and specificity.

    Examples (Illustrative - Adapt to the specific diff and technology):

    **Java (Spring Boot) - New Endpoint:**
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: src/main/java/com/example/MyController.java
    Code Block: 25-35
    Coding Explanation: A new REST endpoint `/api/users/{id}` (GET request) was added. It retrieves a user by ID from `MyService` and returns it. The new method `getUserById` was added to the controller, using Spring's `@GetMapping` and `@PathVariable` annotations.
    Functional Explanation: This exposes a new API endpoint allowing clients to retrieve user details by providing a user ID in the URL. This enables user data retrieval by ID.
    Questions:
        - Is there error handling in `MyService.getUserById` if the user is not found? Should this endpoint return a 404 Not Found in that case?
        - Are there any security considerations for this endpoint (e.g., authentication, authorization)? Should access be restricted?
    ```

    **Java (Spring Boot) - Service Logic Change:**
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: src/main/java/com/example/MyService.java
    Code Block: 42-50
    Coding Explanation: The `processData` method now includes an additional check for `data.isEmpty()` before the main processing logic. If the data is empty, it logs a warning and returns an empty list.
    Functional Explanation: The system now handles cases where input data is empty gracefully, preventing potential errors. The change avoids processing of empty data sets, which might have been unintentional or erroneous.
    Questions:
        - Is returning an empty list the *best* way to handle empty input data? Should an exception be thrown, or a different return value (e.g., null, or a special object) be used?
        - What is the upstream source of `data`? Could the emptiness be handled earlier?
    ```

    **C++ - Algorithm Change:**
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: src/engine/Calculator.cpp
    Code Block: 100-115
    Coding Explanation: The `calculateDistance` function was modified to use a different algorithm. Instead of Euclidean distance, it now uses Manhattan distance. The code sums the absolute differences of the coordinates.
    Functional Explanation: The calculated distance between two points will now be different, reflecting a "city block" distance rather than a straight-line distance. This impacts any feature relying on this distance calculation (e.g., pathfinding).
    Questions:
        - Why was Manhattan distance chosen over Euclidean distance? What requirement or use case motivated this change?
        - Are there unit tests covering this change, and were the expected values updated?
    ```

    **Bazel - New Dependency:**
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: BUILD
    Code Block: 15-18
    Coding Explanation: A new dependency, `@maven//:com_google_guava_guava`, was added to the `java_library` rule for `//src/main/java/com/example/mylib:my_library`.
    Functional Explanation: The `my_library` code can now use classes from the Guava library. This might introduce new functionality or change existing behavior if Guava is used to replace existing logic.
    Questions:
        - What specific parts of Guava are being used, and for what purpose? (Knowing this helps understand the scope.)
        - Was there a reason for choosing Guava over other libraries or built-in functionality?
    ```

	**Terraform - Resource Modification:**
]]
							.. "	```\n"
							.. [[	File: main.tf
	Code Block: 20-25
	Coding Explanation: The `aws_instance` resource named `my_instance` now has `instance_type` set to `t3.small` and `disable_api_termination` set to `true`.
	Functional Explanation: Newly created EC2 instances will be of type `t3.small`. The instance is protected against accidental termination via the API or console.
	Questions:
		- Why was the instance type changed to `t3.small`? Was the previous instance type under- or over-provisioned?
		- Were there any instances created before `disable_api_termination` was set, and are they also protected?
	```

    **GitHub Actions - Workflow Change:**
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: .github/workflows/ci.yml
    Code Block: 30-40
    Coding Explanation: The `checkout` action now includes `fetch-depth: 0`. The build step now uses `bazel build //... --test_output=errors`.
    Functional Explanation: The workflow now fetches the complete Git history. The build process only prints test errors, making the logs less verbose.
    Questions:
        - Why is fetching the entire Git history necessary now? Is a tool being used that depends on it (e.g., versioning)?
        - What motivated the change to `--test_output=errors`? Was the build output too noisy?
    ```
	**JavaScript Example - React Component:**
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: src/components/MyComponent.jsx
    Code Block: 40-55
	Coding Explanation: The component's state management changed. It was refactored from a simple `useState` to handling the previous state in the update function.
    Functional Explanation: The component can now correctly manage state updates, even with rapid updates, avoiding race conditions.
    Questions:
        - What specific scenario prompted this change to use the functional form of `setState`?
		- Are there any asynchronous operations affecting this component's state?
    ```
	**Python Example - List Comprehension:**
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: src/utils/data_processing.py
    Code Block: 18-22
	Coding Explanation: A for loop that iterated through data and calculated filtered squares was replaced with a list comprehension.
    Functional Explanation: This improves code conciseness and potentially readability, and may offer performance benefits in some cases.
    Questions:
        - Was there a performance benchmark done between the for loop and list comprehension?
		- Could the previous logic have returned unexpected values in any edge cases?
    ```

    **C++ - Include and Function Signature Change (from provided diff):**
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: include/some_header.hpp
    Code Block: 5
    Coding Explanation: The `#include <some_container>` directive was changed to `#include <another_container>`.
    Functional Explanation: This suggests a change in the underlying data structure used. Different containers have different performance characteristics for insertion, deletion, search, and iteration. The choice impacts how data is stored and accessed.
    Questions:
        - Why was `another_container` chosen over `some_container`? What specific properties of `another_container` are beneficial here (e.g., ordering, constant-time lookup, memory usage)?
        - Does this change require modifications in other parts of the code that use this header file?
    ```
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: include/data_processor.hpp
    Code Block: 30
    Coding Explanation: The return type of the `processData` method was changed from `void` to `DataType`. The method signature now also receives a `ConfigObject` as input parameter.
    Functional Explanation: The function now returns a value of type `DataType`, indicating that the processing now generates and returns data. It also receives configuration, suggesting its behavior can be customized.
    Questions:
        - What does the `DataType` value represent? What information does it contain?
        - How is the returned `DataType` used by the caller of `processData`?
        - What aspects of the processing are controlled by the `ConfigObject`?
    ```
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: src/data_processor.cpp
    Code Block: 50-60
    Coding Explanation: The constructor of `DataProcessor` now calls `processData` and stores the result in a member variable `processed_data_`. This member variable is then passed to another function, `externalFunction`.
    Functional Explanation: The `DataProcessor` is now using the result of `processData` to initialize its internal state and to interact with `externalFunction`. This suggests that `externalFunction` depends on the processed data.
    Questions:
        - What is the role of `externalFunction`? How does the `processed_data_` affect its behavior?
        - Is there a performance implication of storing `processed_data_`? Could it be large, and is it needed for the lifetime of the `DataProcessor` object?
    ```

]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: src/utility_functions.cpp
    Code Block: 75-85
    Coding Explanation: The `helperFunction` method now initializes a local variable `result` of type `ContainerType`. The method's core logic remains the same, however at the end of the method execution, `result` is returned.
    Functional Explanation: This change makes the method return a collection of data. The internal processing logic hasn't changed in purpose, but the method now provides its output as a return value rather than through (for example) modifying a passed-in parameter.
    Questions:
      - Why does `helperFunction` return `result` and what plans are there for future implementation. It is currently not filled.
      - The old return type was `void`. Was this method performing some side effect, that has now moved to a different place? Or was it refactored to be more functional, avoiding side effects?
    ```

]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: include/converter.hpp
    Code Block: 8
    Coding Explanation: The `#include <set>` directive was changed to `#include <unordered_set>`.
    Functional Explanation: This suggests a potential change in how a set of data is stored and accessed.  `std::set` uses a sorted tree structure (typically a red-black tree), providing logarithmic time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search. `std::unordered_set` uses a hash table, providing average constant-time complexity for these operations, but without maintaining any specific order.  The choice between them impacts performance characteristics.
    Questions:
        - Why was `unordered_set` chosen over `set`?  Was the ordering of elements not needed, and was the potential performance gain of hashing considered significant?
        - Does this change have any implications for the rest of the code that uses this header?
    ```
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: include/converter.hpp
    Code Block: 26
    Coding Explanation: The `SetupConversionConfiguration` method's return type was changed from `void` to `std::unordered_set<std::uint32_t>`. The method signature now receives a `std::vector<io::ConversionMap>` as input.
    Functional Explanation: The function now returns a set of 32-bit unsigned integers, likely representing some form of IDs or identifiers. This indicates that the setup process is now generating and returning some data, where previously it did not return anything.
    Questions:
        - What do the `uint32_t` values in the returned `unordered_set` represent?  Are these message IDs, filter IDs, or something else?
        - How is this returned `unordered_set` used by the caller of `SetupConversionConfiguration`?
        - Was the method changed to avoid side effects and make the data flow more explicit?
    ```
]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: src/converter.cpp
    Code Block: 117-121
    Coding Explanation: The `Converter` constructor now calls `SetupConversionConfiguration` and stores the returned value in a variable named `raw_data_values`. This variable is then passed as the last argument to `codec::CodecFactory::GetCodec`. The arguments for the `GetCodec` are now on separate lines for better readability.
    Functional Explanation: The `Converter` is now using the result of `SetupConversionConfiguration` (presumably a set of values) to configure the codec.  This suggests that the codec's behavior is being customized based on the conversion configuration.
    Questions:
        - What is the role of `raw_data_values` in the `Codec`?  How does this set of IDs affect the codec's behavior?  Does it values data, or control some other aspect of encoding/decoding?
        - Is there a performance impact of passing a potentially large `unordered_set` to `GetCodec`? Could this be optimized if needed?
    ```

]]
							.. "    ```\n"
							.. [[    File: src/converter.cpp
    Code Block: 123-128
    Coding Explanation: The `SetupConversionConfiguration` method now declares a local variable `message_ids_to_convert` of type `std::unordered_set<std::uint32_t>`. The method still has the same logic for calculating `required_source_message_ids_per_trigger_id_`, `required_source_messages_for_buffer_` and `message_buffer_required_`, but returns the new local variable in the end.
    Functional Explanation:  This change prepares the method to return a set of message IDs. The core logic of determining required messages and buffer requirements remains unchanged, but the method's output now includes this additional information.
    Questions:
      - Why does `SetupConversionConfiguration` now return `message_ids_to_convert` and what are the future plans to fill this value? It is currently empty.
      -  The old return type was `void`. Was this method performing some side effect, that has now moved to a different place? Or was it refactored to be more functional, avoiding side effects?
    ```

    Key Considerations:

    *   **Granularity:** Provide explanations at a level of detail appropriate for understanding each change, down to individual lines or groups of lines.
    *   **Coding vs. Functional:** Clearly separate the *code-level* changes from the *functional* impact.
    *   **Targeted Questions:** Focus questions on the *intent*, *reasoning*, and *potential implications* of changes. Ask "why" questions.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:** Consider the surrounding code and the overall system.
    *   **Professional Tone:** Maintain a constructive and respectful tone.
    *   **Microservices Considerations:** If inter-service communication (like gRPC calls) is detected, focus on data exchange and consistency.
Â  Â  * **Gradle Build:** When adding dependencies, focus questions on the purpose of the new dependency.
Â  Â  * **Synchronous Remote Calls:** Focus questions on the purpose of these calls and their impact on performance.
    * **Assumptions:** If you have to *guess* at the purpose, state your assumption and frame questions to confirm or refute it.
	* **Diff navigation**: The prompt is designed to be used with diff hunks, one at a time, or potentially with an entire diff file (if the model's context window allows).

    Optimization for Gemini 2.0 Flash:

    *   **Clear, Concise Instructions:** The prompt is structured logically, with clear sections.
    *   **Specific Output Format:** The required output format is precisely defined.
    *   **Separate Explanations:** The distinct coding and functional explanations are key.
    *   **Question Generation:** Explicitly requesting focused questions is crucial.
    *   **Multiple, Diverse Examples:** The examples cover many scenarios and help guide the model. The new examples based on the provided diff are *very* important, as they show the model exactly what kind of analysis is expected for C++ code.

                        *   `@RequestBody`: If the method accepts a request body, use `@RequestBody` to describe it.  Include a `description` and `content` (with media type and schema).
                        * `@Schema`: Use to fully define return types.
                        *   `@PathVariable`: Use as needed with `@Parameter` for path variables.
                        *   `@RequestParam`: Use as needed with `@Parameter` for query parameters.
                        *   `@RequestHeader`:  Use as needed with `@Parameter` for header parameters.
                        *  Consider adding the annotation @Tag to improve documentation.

          Your task is to create a pull request for the given code changes. Follow these steps:

          1. Analyze the git diff changes provided.
          2. Draft a comprehensive description of the pull request based on the input.
          3. Create the gh CLI command to create a GitHub pull request.

          Output Instructions:
          - The command should start with `gh pr create`.
          - Do not use the new line character in the command since it does not work
          - Output needs to be a multi-line command
          - Include the `--base $(git parent)` flag
          - Use the `--title` flag with a concise, descriptive title matching the commitzen convention.
          - Use the `--body` flag for the PR description.
          - Include the following sections in the body:
            - '## Summary' with a brief overview of changes
            - '## Changes' listing specific modifications
            - '## Additional Notes' for any extra information
